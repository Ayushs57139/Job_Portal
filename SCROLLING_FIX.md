# Scrolling Fix for React Native Web

## Issue
The application was not scrolling on the web platform. Users could not scroll down to see content below the fold.

## Root Cause
React Native Web handles scrolling differently than native platforms. The default configuration didn't properly set up the container heights and overflow properties needed for web scrolling.

## Changes Made

### 1. App.js
- Added web-specific styles injection on component mount
- Set `html`, `body`, and `#root` elements to `height: 100%` and `overflow: hidden`
- Added smooth scrolling support with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`

### 2. src/navigation/AppNavigator.js
- Wrapped NavigationContainer in a View with proper height
- Added `Platform.OS === 'web'` check to set `height: 100%` for web platform
- Imported Platform from 'react-native'

### 3. src/screens/Home/HomeScreen.js
- Updated ScrollView props:
  - Added `showsVerticalScrollIndicator={isWeb ? true : false}` to show scrollbar on web
  - Added `bounces={!isWeb}` to disable bounce effect on web
  - Added `nestedScrollEnabled={true}` for better scroll handling
  
- Updated container styles:
  - Added `height: '100vh'` and `overflow: 'hidden'` for web
  
- Updated scrollView styles:
  - Added `overflow: 'auto'` for web to enable scrolling
  
- Updated scrollContent styles:
  - Removed `flexGrow: 1` (was causing issues)
  - Added `paddingBottom: spacing.xxl` for proper spacing at bottom

## How It Works

The fix works by:
1. Setting the root HTML elements to 100% height with hidden overflow
2. Making the app container and navigation container fill the available height
3. Allowing only the ScrollView to have scrollable overflow (`overflow: 'auto'`)
4. Properly configuring the ScrollView component with web-specific props

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Open in web browser:**
   - Press `w` in the terminal to open in web browser
   - Or navigate to `http://localhost:8081` (or the port shown in terminal)

3. **Test scrolling:**
   - You should now be able to scroll down the page
   - The scrollbar should be visible on the right side (on web)
   - You should be able to see:
     - Hero section with job search
     - Latest Jobs to Apply section
     - Top Companies Hiring section
     - Career Insights & Tips section
     - Resume CTA section
     - Footer

4. **Verify on mobile (optional):**
   - The changes are platform-specific and won't affect mobile behavior
   - Mobile should continue to work as before with native scrolling

## Additional Notes

- All changes use platform-specific styling (`Platform.OS === 'web'`) to ensure native mobile behavior is not affected
- The floating chat button uses `position: 'fixed'` on web and `position: 'absolute'` on mobile for proper positioning
- Horizontal scrolling for companies and blogs sections is unaffected and continues to work properly

## Troubleshooting

If scrolling still doesn't work:

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache and reload

2. **Restart the development server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Clear cache and restart
   npx expo start -c
   ```

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Check for any JavaScript errors
   - Verify the styles are being applied to html/body elements

4. **Verify the root element ID:**
   - In browser DevTools, check if the root div has id="root"
   - If it's different, update the style injection in App.js accordingly

## Files Modified

1. `App.js`
2. `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js`
3. `src/screens/Home/HomeScreen.js`

All changes are backward compatible and use platform-specific code to ensure existing mobile functionality is preserved.
