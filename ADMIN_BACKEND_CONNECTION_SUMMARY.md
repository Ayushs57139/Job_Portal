# Admin Panel Backend Connection - Summary

## Overview
Successfully connected the admin panel to the backend with proper authentication and real-time data fetching.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Configuration (`src/config/api.js`)
- **Exported `API_URL`** constant for direct use in admin screens
- Maintains the existing `JobWalaAPI` class for other parts of the app
- API URL automatically adjusts based on platform (Web/Android/iOS)

### 2. Authentication Implementation
All admin screens now:
- Retrieve auth token from AsyncStorage
- Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in all API requests
- Use native `fetch` API instead of axios (React Native built-in)
- Handle authentication errors properly

### 3. Updated Admin Screens

#### Core Screens with Backend Connection:
1. **AdminDashboardScreen.js**
   - Fetches real-time stats: Total Users, Total Jobs, Applications, Active Jobs
   - Displays recent users table with live data
   - Auto-refreshes on component mount

2. **AdminUsersScreen.js**
   - Lists all users from database
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Toggle user status (Active/Inactive)
   - Delete users with confirmation

3. **AdminJobsScreen.js**
   - Lists all jobs from database
   - Search by title/company
   - Filter by status (Active/Inactive)
   - Toggle job status
   - Delete jobs

4. **AdminApplicationsScreen.js**
   - Lists all job applications
   - Filter by status (Pending, Reviewed, Shortlisted, etc.)
   - Update application status
   - Delete applications

5. **AdminVerificationScreen.js**
   - Lists pending verifications
   - Approve/Reject verifications
   - Real-time status updates

6. **AdminTeamLimitsScreen.js**
   - Displays team limits for employers
   - Shows current member counts

#### Master Data Screens:
7. **MasterDataScreen.js** (Reusable Component)
   - Full CRUD operations with authentication
   - Used by all master data screens:
     - Job Titles
     - Key Skills
     - Industries
     - Departments
     - Courses
     - Specializations
     - Education Fields
     - Locations

## API Endpoints Used

### Dashboard Statistics
```
GET /admin/users/count
GET /admin/jobs/count
GET /admin/applications/count
GET /admin/users/recent
```

### User Management
```
GET    /admin/users
PATCH  /admin/users/:id
DELETE /admin/users/:id
```

### Job Management
```
GET    /admin/jobs
PATCH  /admin/jobs/:id
DELETE /admin/jobs/:id
```

### Application Management
```
GET    /admin/applications
PATCH  /admin/applications/:id
DELETE /admin/applications/:id
```

### Verification Management
```
GET   /admin/verifications
PATCH /admin/verifications/:id/approve
PATCH /admin/verifications/:id/reject
```

### Team Limits
```
GET /admin/team-limits
```

### Master Data (for each entity)
```
GET    /admin/{entity}        - List all
POST   /admin/{entity}        - Create new
PUT    /admin/{entity}/:id    - Update
DELETE /admin/{entity}/:id    - Delete
```

## Authentication Flow

1. Admin logs in through AdminLogin screen
2. JWT token stored in AsyncStorage
3. All API requests include token in Authorization header
4. Backend validates token using `adminAuth` middleware
5. If token invalid/expired, user redirected to login

## Error Handling

All screens now include:
- Try-catch blocks for all API calls
- User-friendly error alerts
- Loading states during API calls
- Fallback to empty/default data on errors
- Console logging for debugging

## Technical Details

### Headers Used:
```javascript
{
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
}
```

### Fetch API Pattern:
```javascript
const token = await AsyncStorage.getItem('token');
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};

if (token) {
  headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
}

const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/admin/endpoint`, { 
  method: 'GET',  // or POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
  headers,
  body: JSON.stringify(data)  // for POST/PUT/PATCH
});

const data = await response.json();
```

## Benefits

✅ **Real-time Data**: Dashboard shows live data from database
✅ **Secure**: All requests authenticated with JWT tokens
✅ **Native**: Uses React Native's built-in fetch API (no axios needed)
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallbacks
✅ **Consistent**: All screens follow same pattern
✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to add new endpoints/screens

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Dashboard displays correct user count
- [ ] Dashboard displays correct job count
- [ ] Dashboard displays correct application count
- [ ] Recent users table populates with data
- [ ] Users screen lists all users
- [ ] User search/filter works
- [ ] Toggle user status works
- [ ] Jobs screen lists all jobs
- [ ] Job search/filter works
- [ ] Toggle job status works
- [ ] Applications screen lists all applications

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add token refresh mechanism
2. Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
3. Add pagination for large datasets
4. Implement bulk operations
5. Add data export functionality
6. Implement advanced filters
7. Add audit logging
8. Implement caching for better performance

## Notes

- All changes use **React Native only** (no HTML)
- Existing functionality **not modified**
- Backward compatible with existing API structure
- No breaking changes to other parts of the app
- Admin authentication required for all endpoints (handled by backend middleware)
