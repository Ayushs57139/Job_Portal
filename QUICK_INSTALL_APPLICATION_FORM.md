**Solution:** 
1. Check if backend server is running
2. Verify backend API endpoint in `src/config/api.js`
3. Check console for error messages

## Backend Requirements

The form sends data to your existing application API endpoint. Make sure your backend:

1. **Has the route** `/api/applications` or `/api/applications/apply`
2. **Accepts** all the fields listed above
3. **Is running** on the correct port
4. **Has CORS enabled** if testing from web

Check `server/routes/applications.js` for the backend implementation.

## Next Steps

After testing, you can customize:
1. **Colors**: Edit `src/styles/theme.js`
2. **Field Options**: Modify radio button options in the component
3. **Validation Rules**: Update validation in `validateStep()` function
4. **API Integration**: Modify `handleSubmit()` function
