- Errors are logged to console for debugging
- Registration process continues even if email fails
- Graceful degradation ensures user experience is not impacted

## Testing

### Test Script
A test script is available at `server/test-welcome-emails.js` to verify email functionality:

```bash
cd server
node test-welcome-emails.js
```

### Manual Testing
To test the welcome emails:

1. Register a new user through any of the registration endpoints
2. Check the user's email inbox for the welcome email
3. Verify email content and formatting
4. Test with different user types (job seeker, company, consultancy)

## Security Considerations

### SMTP Security
- Uses TLS encryption for email transmission
- Credentials are hardcoded (consider moving to environment variables for production)
- `rejectUnauthorized: false` is set for development (should be reviewed for production)

### Email Security
- No sensitive information in email content
- Unsubscribe links included for compliance
- Professional email templates to prevent spam classification

## Production Recommendations

### Environment Variables
For production deployment, consider moving email credentials to environment variables:

```javascript
auth: {
  user: process.env.SMTP_USER || 'Info@freejobwala.com',
  pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS || 'Raju#Pooja@4321#'
}
```

### Email Service Provider
Consider using a dedicated email service provider for better deliverability:
- SendGrid
- Mailgun
- Amazon SES
- Postmark

### Monitoring
Implement email delivery monitoring:
- Track email send success/failure rates
- Monitor bounce rates
- Set up alerts for email service issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify email credentials
   - Check if 2FA is enabled (may need app-specific password)
   - Ensure SMTP settings are correct

2. **Emails Not Delivered**
   - Check spam/junk folders
   - Verify recipient email addresses
   - Check SMTP server status

3. **Template Rendering Issues**
   - Verify HTML syntax in email templates
   - Test with different email clients
   - Check for missing CSS or broken links

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in nodemailer:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  // ... other options
  debug: true,
  logger: true
});
```
